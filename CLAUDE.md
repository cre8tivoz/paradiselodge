# CLAUDE.md — The Paradise Lodge

Standing rules. Read every session. `docs/BRIEF.md` is the design spec, `docs/ASSETS.md` is the art and audio list.

## What this is

A first-person detective game. St Kilda, 26 February 1994. Five scenes. No combat.

The player is Detective Graham Miller. You never see him until the last shot of the game.

---

## Status

Last updated 28 July 2026. Update this whenever a step lands.

Repo is `github.com/cre8tivoz/paradiselodge`, branch `main`. Cloudflare Pages is deliberately not connected yet. That happens once scene 1 plays end to end.

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| 1. Player controller | Done. Walk, crouch, lean, mouse look, pointer lock |
| 2. Look raycast, one-line description | Done |
| 3. Hand rig, gloves, one examine animation | Done |
| 3b. Hand mesh | Done. Blender segmented glTF at `public/models/miller-hand.glb` |
| 4. Examine tier two, held input | Done. Confirmed in browser. Hold F; release cancels |
| 5. Case file, evidence IDs, notebook UI | Done. N opens. Examine files. Idempotent |
| 6. Room 1A, geometry, fixed 3pm sun | Done. Kit furniture, sash, sun across the bed |
| 7. Crystal + examine set | Done. Kit Crystal on the bed. Twelve room 1A clips. Six evidence IDs file here; diary and hammer wait for parlour and yard |

Everything from step 8 on is untouched.

### Added outside the build order

- **Run.** Shift plus forward, standing only. 4.6 against a 2.2 walk. Refused when moving backwards, strafing, or crouched. No stamina, because there are no fail states. It exists for the scene 3 chase
- **Drag to look.** Pointer lock is still preferred and still tried first. Embedded preview panes and some sandboxed documents refuse it outright with `WrongDocumentError`, so holding the left button turns the view instead, and the prompt says which one you are getting

### Scaffolding, and when it goes

| Thing | Goes at |
|---|---|
| `src/world/greybox.ts` | Gone. Replaced by room 1A at step 6 |
| The pointer lock prompt and its CSS | When the real HUD lands |
| `window.__lodge` dev handle | Stays. It is `import.meta.env.DEV` only, and the capture tooling wants it |

## Decisions taken during the build

Settled. Do not re-litigate these without a reason.

- `three` is pinned to `0.180.0`. `npm install three` gives r185 and breaks the locked stack silently
- `strict` and `noImplicitOverride` were added to `tsconfig.json` by hand. The current Vite vanilla-ts template ships without `strict`
- Everything solid lives under a `world` group. The camera is a sibling of it and Miller's hands are children of the camera. That split is what keeps his own hands out of the look raycast. Do not raycast the whole scene, and do not solve it with render layers: a light in three only illuminates objects sharing its layer, so a layer split silently unlights the hands. That is the reference repo's viewmodel bug, reproduced
- Wrist roll goes through a wrist pivot, never the hand root. Rolling the root swings the forearm across the camera
- No new events were added. A run is told from a walk by the `speed` already carried in `player:footstep`
- `LOOP.maxDelta` is 0.05 and is a collision guard, not just a tab-out guard. Collision is a pushout, not a swept test. Raise it, or raise `runSpeed`, and check the arithmetic in the comment or Miller goes through a wall on a stalled frame

Assumptions, flagged, cheap to change:

- **Glove colour.** ASSETS.md gives none and the palette has no token for one. `HANDS.glove` is pale cream latex, period correct for 1994. One value
- **`sun-shadow`.** ASSETS.md lists `#6E6croll`, which is not a colour. The note in that table says `#6E6255`. That is what the palette uses
- **The date is settled.** BRIEF.md still carries it as the one open decision, but ASSETS.md and both title cards say 26 February 1994. That section of BRIEF.md can go
- **Look sensitivity** is 0.0022 rad/px, picked blind, shared between pointer lock and drag. Untuned

## Hand mesh

Done. Segmented gloved right hand authored in Blender, exported as glTF.

- Source: `tools/blender/build_miller_hand.py` → `assets/blender/miller-hand.blend`
- Ship: `public/models/miller-hand.glb`
- Runtime: `rig.ts` loads the glTF and drives named joints (`index_j0` … `thumb_j1`). `clip.ts`, `clips.ts`, and `hands.ts` stay mesh-agnostic
- Left hand is the same mesh with `scale.x = -1` and double-sided materials
- Rebuild: with Blender MCP on port 9876, run the build script via `execute_code`

Reference remains `images/characters/miller-hands.png`.

## Stack — locked

```
Engine      Three.js r180, WebGL2
Language    TypeScript, strict. No any, no ! assertions
Build       Vite
Deploy      Cloudflare Pages, static, own project on a subdomain of billyhaddad.au
            Not inside the author site's Astro build
Audio       Web Audio API
Physics     None. No library, no engine
```

**No physics engine.** Miller walks on a navmesh and raycasts at things. There are no rigid bodies, no ragdolls, no projectiles. If you find yourself wanting Rapier or Cannon, you have misread the design.

**No framework.** No React, no Vue. The HUD is DOM and CSS over the canvas.

**One runtime dependency: `three`.** Do not add others without being asked.

---

## Do not build

This list exists because the genre invites all of it and none of it belongs.

- Combat of any kind. No weapons, no health, no damage
- An inventory, item screen, or item combining
- Free-form physics grabbing. Hand interactions are bespoke animations
- Pursuit or flee AI. The scene 3 chase is a scripted set piece with a fixed path
- A dialogue camera that leaves first person
- Fail states. The player cannot lose. They can only be slow
- Procedural generation of anything. Every room is authored
- A map or quest marker. Rosie points, the geometry does the rest

### The images folder

`/images/characters/` holds a generated reference sheet per character, named `<character>-sheet.png`. Build geometry and materials against these. If a sheet is missing, say so and stop. Do not invent a placeholder character and do not proceed on a guess.

`/images/assets/` holds generated textures at working size. When one is final it gets resized to power-of-two and copied to `public/textures/`. The original stays where it is.

One subsystem per directory. A subsystem never reaches into another's internals. They talk through the event bus in `core/`.

---

## Event vocabulary

Emit and listen. Do not add events without adding them here.

```
scene:load        { id }
scene:complete    { id }
gate:unlocked     { gateId }

look:enter        { objectId }
look:exit         { objectId }
examine:start     { objectId }
examine:complete  { objectId }
tag:requested     { objectId }
tag:bagged        { objectId }

evidence:filed    { evidenceId, sourceObject }
casefile:open     {}
casefile:close    {}

dialogue:start    { nodeId, speaker }
dialogue:choice   { nodeId, optionId }
dialogue:end      { nodeId }

player:footstep   { position, surface, speed }
player:state      { stance }
```

## The four verbs

Look, examine, talk, tag. That is the whole game.

**Look** is a centre-screen raycast. It writes a one-line surface description. It never creates evidence and it never signals importance.

**Examine** is held input on a looked-at object. It plays a bespoke hand animation, then writes the tier-two text. Only this creates evidence.

**Talk** opens a dialogue node. Camera stays in first person.

**Tag** calls Moretti over. He bags it. Miller does not carry it.

Miller touches things. He does not pocket them. He can turn the photo frame over. He cannot take it.

---

## Writing rules

All in-game text follows these. No exceptions.

- Australian English
- No em dashes
- Contractions throughout
- No editorialising. Never tell the player something is suspicious, strange, or important
- No echo-padding in dialogue
- Trust the player

Wrong:

> The rubber tie has been suspiciously tied in a neat, careful knot, which suggests someone else may have done it.

Right:

> The tie's neat. Even tension, tucked under itself. Nobody does that one-handed with their teeth.

## Build order

Do not scaffold five scenes. Scene 1 is roughly 80% of the engine and everything after it is content in the same systems.

1. Player controller. Walk, crouch, lean. First person, no body — **done**
2. Look raycast and the one-line description — **done**
3. Hand rig and gloves. One contextual examine animation, proven on a single object — **done**
4. Examine tier two, held input — **done**
5. Case file. Evidence IDs, notebook UI — **done**
6. Room 1A. Geometry, fixed 3pm sun — **done**
7. Crystal as a prop. Twelve room 1A clips. Six evidence IDs file here; diary and hammer wait — **done**
8. Dialogue system — **next**
9. Rosie at reception, then relocated to the parlour
10. Moretti. Navmesh follow, tag and bag
11. Rest of the lodge. Street, entry, hallway, stairs, verandah, yard
12. Objective gates, scene exit
13. Scene manager, save on scene boundary
14. Cold open sequence, last

Verify in the browser between each step. Do not stack three steps in one prompt.

---

## Performance target

60 fps at 1080p. These are small interiors with a fixed sun and no dynamic combat. If you are under 60, you have over-built the render pipeline, not under-optimised it.

Do not add TAA, GTAA, cascaded shadow maps, or motion blur. A single directional light with a shadow map, baked ambient, and a light grade is enough and it is the correct amount.

---

## Miller ages

Forty days pass between scene 1 and scene 5. The player never sees his face, so the wear is carried by the hands and the environment.

| Scene | Cuffs | Gloves | Car |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Clean, buttoned | Fresh | Washed |
| 2 | Buttoned | None | Dusty |
| 3 | Rolled once | None | Dirty |
| 4 | Rolled, grubby | None | Not seen |
| 5 | Rolled, worse | None | Filthy |

Same coffee cup in scenes 2 and 4. Do not draw attention to any of it.
