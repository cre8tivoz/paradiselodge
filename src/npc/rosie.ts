/**
 * Rosie Lodge. The lodging house manager, and the only person in scene 1 who
 * talks back.
 *
 * BRIEF.md: "Rosie appears twice. Once at reception on the way in, brief and
 * directive. Once in the parlour on the way back down, for the 2am
 * conversation. She relocates between beats."
 *
 * So she is one figure with two stations, not two figures. Relocating rather
 * than duplicating is what makes the parlour beat land: the player was told
 * where she would be, and she is there.
 *
 * Geometry comes from public/models/rosie.glb, authored in Blender. See the
 * Rosie mesh section of CLAUDE.md. This file is the only one that knows about
 * the glTF.
 *
 * ## She is rooted, and that is the whole animation budget
 *
 * BRIEF.md has her rooted at both stations, which means there is no walk cycle,
 * no path and no navmesh work here. What is left is the difference between a
 * mannequin and a person standing still: she breathes, she shifts her weight,
 * she smokes, and she looks at whoever is talking to her.
 *
 * All of it is procedural. There are no authored clips on this mesh and there
 * do not need to be.
